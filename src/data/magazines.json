    "description": "In 1917, following the death of John Alexander Hill, James H. McGraw merged the McGraw and the Hill Publishing Companies. With the merger of both companies the unification of the engineering journals seemed logical, but the proposal met with strong resistance. If magazines can possess personalities, then the Record was perceived as aggressive and vulgar, while the News was considered stodgy and abstruse. The staff at the Record lobbied for their publication's independence. McGraw, however, wanted to forge an alliance with the News because of its standing in the higher echelons of the profession. The first issue of Engineering News-Record was published on April 5, 1917. On January 1st, 1987 the acronym ENR was adopted as the title of the magazine.",
